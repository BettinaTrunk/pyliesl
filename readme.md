### LieSL

is a repository adding several convenient tools to LSL (https://pypi.org/project/pylsl/).

This are accessible through the terminal, e.g. 
```{bash}
usage: liesl [-h] {config,list,show,mock} ...

positional arguments:
  {config,list,show,mock}
    config              initialize the lsl_api.cfg for all users with system,
                        globally for this user with global or locally in this
                        folder with local
    list                list available LSL streams
    show                Visualize a specific LSL streams
    mock                mock a LSL stream

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

```
or as importable modules with more or less documentation. 

This is not a stable repository, as i constantly tweak modules to fit my current needs.
But feel free to share, contribute or copy at will.
